Carousel - Photo Slider
=================

Project Description
-------------------

This project has been completed as part of The Odin Project. The goal of the project is to practice jQuery by developing an interactive photo slider similar to that found in the jQuery UI library.

My project uses basic jQuery animations to manipulate the photo slider and its component buttons.

All photo credit also goes to me ^_^ You can find these and more on my instagram - @patmallee
