[View this project in the browser!](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/patmallee/Carousel---Photo-Slider/blob/master/carousel.html)

Purpose
-------

This project has been completed as part of [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com). The goal of the project is to practice jQuery by developing an interactive photo slider similar to that found in the jQuery UI library.

My project uses basic jQuery animations to manipulate the photo slider and its component buttons.
